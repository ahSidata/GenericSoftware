# Requirements

1. **Language**
   - All code comments, log messages, summaries, and documentation must be in **English**.

2. **Device Power Limits**
   - Each battery device (`DeviceList`) can be set between **0 W and ApiSettingMaxPower / device count**.
   - No device may ever be set to a negative power value.
   - The sum of all device power values is limited to **ApiSettingMaxPower** (e.g., 840 W for 2 batteries).

3. **Grid Feed-in Handling**
   - If `TotalPower` (grid draw) is **negative** and Abs(TotalPower) exceeds ApiSettingMaxPower, all device power values must be set to **0 W**.
   - If `TotalPower` (grid draw) is **positive** and Abs(TotalPower) exceeds ApiSettingMaxPower, all device power values must be set to **ApiSettingMaxPower / device count**.
   - In all other cases, power regulation should take place to keep the grid draw close to target values.

4. **Hysteresis**
   - If the deviation from the offset is within a configurable **hysteresis range** (e.g., ±10 W),
   all device power values must remain unchanged to avoid unnecessary switching. However, load balancing should still take place.

5. **Grid Draw Regulation**
   - The algorithm aims to keep `TotalPower` as close as possible to the configured offset (`ApiSettingAvgPowerOffset`).
   - The correction power is calculated as: `int delta = value.TotalPower - ApiSettingAvgPowerOffset;`
   - If `delta` is positive, power is distributed to eligible devices to increase grid draw.
   - If `delta` is negative, power is distributed to eligible devices to decrease grid draw.
   - Power allocation per device is limited between **0 W and ApiSettingMaxPower / device count**.
   - Power is distributed according to device priority (SoC-based):
     - For positive delta: devices with higher SoC are prioritized
     - For negative delta: devices with lower SoC are prioritized
     - When SoC values are equal, power is distributed equally.
   - Only non-empty devices are eligible for power allocation. Devices that are empty (i.e., `IsBatteryEmpty == true`) are excluded and set to **0 W**.

6. **Adjustment Factor**
   - The setting **ApiSettingPowerAdjustmentFactor** must be used to scale the delta for power regulation.
   - A value of 100 represents 100% of delta, and must be divided by 100 in the formula: `adjustedDelta = delta * (ApiSettingPowerAdjustmentFactor / 100.0)`
   - `CurrentState.PowerValueTotalCommited` contains the current total power value assigned to devices.
   This is the basis for calculating power distribution using the adjustment factor.
   - If `CurrentState.PowerValueTotalCommited` is negative or NULL, it should be set to 0.
   - For negative deltas: `int desiredTotalPower = Math.Max(0, powerValueTotalCommited + adjustedDelta);`
   - If the delta is higher then one device is possible to handle the delta should be balanced,
   but if it is possible handle with one power set on one device without change other devices it should be prefered

7. **SoC-based Load Balancing**
   - Power is distributed among eligible devices **proportional to their SoC priority**.
   - The allocation per device is limited between **0 W and ApiSettingMaxPower / device count**.
   - When within the hysteresis range, load balancing should still occur to equalize battery levels.

8. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - All decisions, calculations, allocations, and actions must be logged in English.
   - Logs should include device serial, SoC, allocation, changes, and reasons for setting power or skipping devices.
   - Each significant step in the process should be logged with appropriate context information.

9. **General**
   - Ensure robustness against all edge cases (no eligible devices, all empty, negative power, etc.).
   - Under no circumstances should negative device power values be set.
   - All code comments must be in English, in addition to log messages.
   - PowerValueRequested is not allowed to set it will be set after EnqueueAsync running successfuly
